# CodeAtlas

Hi!👋🏼

I am Andrei, a 25 y/o Software Engineer from Sibiu, Romania.

### **Welcome to my _Code Atlas_!** 😁

In this small repository I intend to store any code snippet, app, program and/or project that I make.\
In some cases, you will come upon this repository because I sent it to you to take a look, in other cases you might see it because you are an employer who followed the link to my GitHub profile.

**In any case, I am glad you made it here!** 😉

The folder structure is pretty much intuitive, I have a folder for each major technology / programming language that is used in a project, code snippet and so on.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository does not encompass the full extent of my software development knowledge and skills, it is merely an extension of it.
> > Although you are free to have your doubts about this... 🤔

### _**Enjoy**_!
